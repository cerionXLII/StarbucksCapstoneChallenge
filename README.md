# Starbucks Capstone Challenge
This notebook applied Data Science methods to Starbucks customer data. 

# Explore Data
First the data is explored, and basic distributions are plotted. The data itself comes from a simulation made by Starbucks on how their customors respond to different campaigns. Are they using the offers presented? Are they likely to even opt-in on the offers? 

# Transform Data
The data is basically a transaction log of how the clients behave. For example how much is a client spending during the campaign period? Do they use the offers, and so on? We need to transform the data into something more useful in order to make predictions.

# Machine Learning Model
The final step is to create a machine learning model to see if we can predict if a user will complete an offer or not. A classifier is trained on the data and then evaluated on a test set to see how well it performs.
